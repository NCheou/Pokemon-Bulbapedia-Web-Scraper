# Pokemon-Bulbapedia-Web-Scraper

I like performing random analyses of data, and as a child Pokemon was near and dear to my heart. I have fond memories of playing Pokemon with my cousins, so I wanted to work with Pokemon data for my first project. I downloaded a data set off of Kaggle, but that didn't have all the Pokemon I wanted. So I decided to look for a web scraper already made, but all the ones I found didn't work, so I decided to create my own. This is a script to scrape Pokemon data I was interested in collecting. I started this project as a beginner, so I wanted to provide detailed explanations for every step of my processes. Some manual cleanup of information was required, and this sheet does not include Mega Evolutions nor regional variants.
